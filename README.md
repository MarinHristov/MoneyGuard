# 💰 MoneyGuard – XDR for Your Wallet and Business

> “Because your finances deserve more monitoring than your mom’s Facebook stalking habits.”

## What is MoneyGuard?

Imagine **XDR security software**… but for your **personal finances or small business operations**.  

- It **ingests financial and operational data** automatically.  
- It **detects anomalies** (like suspicious transactions or inventory vanishing into thin air).  
- It **alerts you** before your wallet or business collapses.  
- And it **visualizes everything** in a dashboard that actually makes sense.  

Basically, it’s like hiring a tiny, overworked SOC team, but without the crippling existential dread.

## Why You Should Care

- **Stop overspending** like it’s a competitive sport.  
- **Catch inventory weirdness** before someone “borrows” your staplers… permanently.  
- **See everything in one dashboard** instead of scrolling through 14 apps and 3 spreadsheets while crying quietly.  

Think of MoneyGuard as:  
> “Your finances, but with a bodyguard who never sleeps… and doesn’t judge your impulse buys.”
