## What is FiscOwl?

FiscOwl is **XDR for finances and small business operations**:

- Automatically ingests financial and operational data.  
- Detects anomalies like suspicious transactions or missing inventory.  
- Sends alerts before chaos strikes.  
- Visualizes everything in a dashboard that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.

Basically, it’s like hiring a tiny, overworked SOC team… without the existential dread.
